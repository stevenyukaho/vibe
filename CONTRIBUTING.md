# Contributing to IBM VIBE

Thanks for your interest in contributing to IBM VIBE (Validation & Insights for Behavioral Evaluation).

By participating in this project, you agree to follow our [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs and propose improvements via GitHub Issues
- Improve documentation
- Submit pull requests with fixes or new features

## Development setup

IBM VIBE is a monorepo managed with npm workspaces.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (see the repository `README.md` for the supported version range)
- npm

### Install

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the stack (development)

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Quality gates

Before opening a pull request, please run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:ts
```

If your changes affect formatting, you can format supported files with:

```bash
npm run format
```

You can also run checks per workspace:

```bash
npm run lint -w backend
npm run lint -w frontend
npm run lint -w agent-service-api
```

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes with appropriate tests.
3. Run the quality gates above.
4. Open a pull request and fill out the template.

## Testing philosophy

When changing behavior, prefer test-driven development:

1. Add or update a test that fails for the current behavior.
2. Implement the fix/change until the test passes.
3. Refactor while keeping tests green.

## Legal (DCO sign-off)

This project uses a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` line.

- Read: [`DCO.md`](DCO.md)
- Sign off commits by using:

```bash
git commit -s
```

Our CI checks will fail if commits in a pull request are missing the sign-off.
